APEX LEGENDS PREMIUM CHEAT: User Guide

Thank you for choosing APEX LEGENDS PREMIUM CHEAT! Before you dive into the action, here's a comprehensive guide to help you get started:

Supported Resolutions:

Our cheat currently supports resolutions of 2560x1440 and 3840x2160. Please ensure your display settings match one of these resolutions for optimal performance.
How It Works:

Controller Compatibility: Our program is tailor-made for controller use, offering seamless integration with your gaming setup.
Key Mapping: Begin by assigning keyboard keys to your preferred controller buttons. If you're using Steam, access the controller settings by clicking on the controller logo and selecting "Edit". Assign the desired keyboard buttons to their corresponding controller buttons.
Game Settings: Launch Apex Legends and navigate to Settings > Mouse and Keyboard Settings. Set the sensitivity for looking around to 0.20 and ensure that the jump action is mapped to the scrollwheel back.
Customization: Exit Apex Legends and open the downloaded folder. Navigate to Settings > config_parameters and open custom_user_preferences. Here, you can fine-tune the keybinds to match your controller setup. Edit the variables activate_armor_swap, activate_super_jump, activate_survival_slot, use_survival_slot, activate_mantle_jump, key1_pressed_for_anti_recoil, and key2_pressed_for_anti_recoil to your preferred keybinds.
In-Game Configuration: Assign interact, move_forward, and move_back to the corresponding keybinds in APEX LEGENDS.
Launching the Program: Once you've completed these steps, launch the program, select your screen resolution, and start playing.
Important Note: Please be aware that key1_pressed_for_anti_recoil and key2_pressed_for_anti_recoil are typically triggered when you press L2 and R3 on your controller.
